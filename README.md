# Zoo-keepr

  ## Description
With this app, I created a web server using the Express.js framework and added it to a front-end application that an imaginary local zoo is developing, called 'Zoo Keepr'. The siteâ€™s data lives on the server I built so that anyone can access it without having to download it. I also deployed the application to Heroku, a cloud application platform that allows you to deploy applications with servers to a webpage.
  
  #### Technologies Used

Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It is considered the de facto standard server framework for Node.js. (https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)

Insomnia is a powerful REST API client that allows us to test APIs and make client-side server requests without having to use a browser. (https://insomnia.rest/
