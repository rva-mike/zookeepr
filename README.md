# Zoo-keepr

  ## Description
With this app, I created a web server using the Express.js framework and added it to a front-end application that an imaginary local zoo is developing, called 'Zoo Keepr'. The site’s data lives on the server I built so that anyone can access it without having to download it. I also deployed the application to Heroku, a cloud application platform that allows you to deploy applications with servers to a webpage.
  
  #### Technologies Used

Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It is considered the de facto standard server framework for Node.js. (https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)

Insomnia is a powerful REST API client that allows us to test APIs and make client-side server requests without having to use a browser. (https://insomnia.rest/
)

Heroku is a cloud application platform that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud. Unlike GitHub pages, which only allows you to deploy static sites with HTML pages, Heroku allows you to deploy a server.js file that will run the Node.js process. You’ll also use the Heroku CLI Links to an external site., which will help you deploy apps easily without leaving the command line. (https://heroku.com/)
